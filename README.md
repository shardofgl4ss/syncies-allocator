# Syncies-Arena-Allocator

Still a heavy WIP, but slowly developing. A full alternative to the libc malloc() API using virtual memory pools. This is my own passion project and I'm not an expert, so take it with a grain of salt.

If your expertise is in data structures or memory management please do review!
