# Syncies-Arena-Allocator

Still a heavy WIP, but slowly developing. A full thread-local alternative to malloc() using entirely virtual memory pools as a fail-fast handle based allocator. This is my own passion project and I'm not an expert, so take it with a grain of salt.

If your expertise is in data structures or memory management please do review!

Also, this allocator probably will not work until it is fully complete. Be warned if you want to test it, it might not even compile until complete.
